## Setup

For setup, `npm install` all the packages for the project.

## Test Suite

This project uses the test suite [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to test the api and make sure all endpoints work as intended.

To use the test suite, run `npm test` to ensure all endpoints are working as desired before running the server.

## Running the server

To run the server locally, first run `npm run dev` to activate the server.

All information on the available endpoints can be accessed on http://localhost:9090/api.

All GET requests can be done by following the desired endpoint. For POST, PATCH and DELETE, please use a REST client.
